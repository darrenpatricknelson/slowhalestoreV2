# slowhalestoreV2

Project name: SlowhalestoreV2

Description: Slowhale store is owned and operated by two friends of mine, Zoe and Leah. They make and sell bikinis as well as other clothing items and accesseries. I built their online store as a favor for them but also so that I can get practice as well as build my profile. The store is not 100%, it is a work in progress but is still something I can be proud of. The project is an onlione store that sells bikinis and other beach/ summer accessories.
