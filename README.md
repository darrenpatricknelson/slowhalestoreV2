# slowhalestoreV2

Project name: SlowhalestoreV2

Description: Slowhale store is owned and operated by two friends of mine, Zoe and Leah. They make and sell bikinis as well as other clothing items and accesseries. I built their online store as a favor for them but also so that I can get practice as well as build my profile. The store is not 100%, it is a work in progress but is still something I can be proud of.

TOC: README not long enough for a table of contents

Usage section: I'm unsure on what you mean when you say 'others users should install my project'? This is a website and not an installable app.
